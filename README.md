### Hi there 👋

This is Dong Zhou, a former researcher at Microsoft Research Asia specializing in quantitative research and machine learning, and the author of [Qlib](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib), [Temporal Routing Adaptor (TRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12950), and [Deep Risk Model (DRM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05201).

Currently, I lead the Alpha Research team at [Semimartingale Private Fund Management (半鞅私募基金)](https://banyangcap.com)), where we develop machine-learning-driven strategies for China’s stocks and futures markets. We're actively seeking talented individuals passionate about quantitative finance and trading technology. If that sounds like you, feel free to [reach out](mailto:hr@banyangcap.com)!
